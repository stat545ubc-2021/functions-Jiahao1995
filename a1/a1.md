## Exercise 1 & 2: Make a Function with Documents (25 + 20 points)

``` r
#' k-th largest element of a vector
#' 
#' This function returns the k-th largest element in a vector with two parameters, nums and k on a 1-index basis. 
#' If k is smaller than 1, this function will show a warning message and set k to 1 automatically. 
#' Also if k is larger than the length of the vector, this function will show a warning message, 
#' and set k to the length of the vector automatically.
#' 
#' @param nums, a numeric vector where we would like to find elements. This function is trying to find a target in a group of numbers so this parameter is named as nums.
#' @param k, a numeric value that specifies the k-th largest element in the vector. This function is trying to find the k-th largest element in a vector so this parameter is named as k.
#' @return a numeric value which is the k-th largest element in the vector



kth_largest_element <- function(nums, k) {
  if (!is.numeric(nums)) {
    stop("Error: object for 'nums' must be numeric. You have input an object of class: ", class(nums)[1])
  }
  if (!is.numeric(k)) {
    stop("Error: object for 'k' must be numeric. You have input an object of class: ", class(nums)[2])
  }
  len <- length(nums)
  if (len == 0) {
    stop("Error: 'nums' is empty. Cannot find any target in an empty vector")
  }
  if (k < 1) {
    warning("'k' is smaller than 1, setting k = 1")
    k <- 1
  }
  if (k > len) {
    warning("'k' is larger than length of nums, ", len, ", setting k = ", len)
    k <- len
  }
  return (sort(nums,partial=len-k+1)[len-k+1])
}
```

## Exercise 3: Include examples (15 points)

``` r
# example vector with elements from 0 to 9
nums <- c(5, 4, 8, 7, 3, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0)

# k = 1, should get the largest element in this vector, which is 9
kth_largest_element(nums, 1)
```

    ## [1] 9

``` r
# k = -1, the input makes no sense, but the function will still get the largest element in this vector, 9
kth_largest_element(nums, -1)
```

    ## Warning in kth_largest_element(nums, -1): 'k' is smaller than 1, setting k = 1

    ## [1] 9

``` r
# k = 100, if k is larger than the length of the vector, it will get the smallest element in this vector, which is 0
kth_largest_element(nums, 100)
```

    ## Warning in kth_largest_element(nums, 100): 'k' is larger than length of nums,
    ## 10, setting k = 10

    ## [1] 0

``` r
# k = 3, which is a normal case, it will simply get the third largest element in this vector
kth_largest_element(nums, 3)
```

    ## [1] 7

## Exercise 4: Test the Function (25 points)

``` r
suppressMessages(library(testthat))
```

### Test 1: Vector with no NAâ€™s

``` r
# For a normal numeric vector, it will return the k-th largest element
normal_vector = c(5, 4, 8, 7, 3, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0)
test_that("Test 1", {
  expect_equal(7, kth_largest_element(normal_vector, 3))
})
```

    ## Test passed ðŸ˜¸

### Test 2: Vector of a different type

``` r
# For a character vector, it will throw an error message
char_vector = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
test_that("Test 2", {
  expect_error(kth_largest_element(char_vector, 4))
})
```

    ## Test passed ðŸ˜€

### Test 3: Vector of length 0

``` r
# For an empty vector, it will throw an error message
zero_vector = c()
test_that("Test 2", {
  expect_error(kth_largest_element(zero_vector, 4))
})
```

    ## Test passed ðŸ¥³
